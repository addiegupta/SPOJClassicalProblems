According to Wikipedia, an arithmetic progression (AP) is a 
sequence of numbers such that the difference of any two successive members of the sequence is a constant. 
For instance, the sequence 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, . . . is an arithmetic progression with common difference 2.
For this problem, we will limit ourselves to arithmetic progression whose common difference is a non-zero integer.

On the other hand, a geometric progression (GP) is a sequence of numbers where each term after the first is
found by multiplying the previous one by a fixed non-zero number called the common ratio.
For example, the sequence 2, 6, 18, 54, . . . is a geometric progression with common ratio 3. 
For this problem, we will limit ourselves to geometric progression whose common ratio is a non-zero integer.
Given three successive members of a sequence, you need to determine the type of the progression 
and the next successive member.

Example:

Input:
4 7 10
2 6 18
0 0 0

Output:
AP 13
GP 54
